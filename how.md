## Purpose

Easily find metrically compatible replacement fonts for LibreOffice, ensuring documents created in MS Office retain the
same layout when opened in LibreOffice.

## How to Implement

1. Install as many fonts as possible locally, including those from MS and other open-source and free options.
2. Build a local JSON file to serve as a small database containing the fonts, their metrics, and licensing information.
3. Develop a simple HTML page to display the metrics and licensing information of the fonts, including a comparison
   feature.

## Usage

When encountering a font issue in LibreOffice due to the use of MS or other commercial fonts, use this page to find a
compatible font and add it to your font substitution table in LibreOffice.
